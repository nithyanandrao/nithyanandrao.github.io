I'm a graduate student (Fall 2020-- ) in the [Department of Communication](https://communication.ucsd.edu/) / [Science Studies Program](https://sciencestudies.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I'm interested in studying the practice of science in contemporary India and how it influences, and is influenced by, hierarchies of various kinds. Also interested in how the narratives surrounding science and technology, especially in media coverage, influence our views of peoples, knowledges, and their histories.

Previously a science writer and a lapsed physicist.
