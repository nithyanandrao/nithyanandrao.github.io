I'm a graduate student (Fall 2020-- ) in the [Department of Communication](https://communication.ucsd.edu/) / [Science Studies Program](https://sciencestudies.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I'm interested in how knowledge production in the "global south", particularly in India, fits within global hierarchies, and the ways in which this is influenced by and influences our views of nations, peoples, knowledges and their histories, especially in public and media discourse.

Previously, I was a staff writer/editor for [<em>Connect</em>](https://connect.iisc.ac.in), the official magazine of the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in) in Bangalore, India. Independently, I freelanced occasionally for the mainstream media in India, mostly for the science section of [<em>The Wire</em>](https://science.thewire.in). I also co-founded the mathematics magazine [<em>Bhāvanā</em>](https://bhavana.org.in).

In a former life, I did a Master's in Physics and then worked in the editorial office of [Wiley India Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.wileyindia.com/), the Indian subsidiary of [John Wiley & Sons, Inc](http://www.wiley.com/).
