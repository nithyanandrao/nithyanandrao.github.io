I'm an incoming graduate student in the Department of Communication / Science Studies Program at the University of California San Diego.


This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages, which is a template forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have by [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com).
