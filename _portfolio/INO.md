On the controversies surrounding the India-based Neutrino Observatory, a proposed particle physics experiment in Theni district, Tamil Nadu, that has faced public opposition. I co-wrote it with my friend Virat Markandeya. It was my first story for the mainstream media, and it won the [RedInk Award](http://www.mumbaipressclub.com/public/index.php/redink2017) in the Science & Innovation Category for 2017, awarded by the [Mumbai Press Club](https://thewire.in/media/redink-award-india-based-neutrino-observatory). Read it [here](https://thewire.in/history/why-indias-most-sophisticated-science-experiment-languishes-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place).
